# ESP-IDF Provisioning - Android

ESP-IDF consists of a provisioning mechanism, which is used to provide network credentials and/or custom data to an ESP32 device.
This repository contains the source code for the companion Android app for this provisioning mechanism.

## Configuring Build

There are multiple build options. It is a combination of 3 options - transport, security and release type.

- Transports 
  - WiFi
  - BLE
- Security
  - 0 (no security)
  - 1 (security as per IDF docs for provisioning)
- Release type
  - Debug
  - Release

So you can pick a build type as `bleSec1Debug`. Note that except for Release type, if you change any of the above options, you will have to change the corresponding firmware on ESP32.
